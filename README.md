docker-compose -f local.yml build
```

3. Initialize Git

```bash
git init
```

4. Run the Pre-commit command to install it on the project

```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Remove all

```bash
docker system prune --volumes -a -f
```

```bash
docker system prune -a -f
```

## Build / Run the Image

```bash
docker-compose -f local.yml build
```

```bash
docker-compose -f local.yml up
```

```bash
docker-compose -f local.yml up --build
```

## Set the default compose-file

```bash
export COMPOSE_FILE=local.yml
```

## Execute Management Commands

```bash
docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django python manage.py create_local_user_and_admin
```

```bash
docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django python manage.py makemigrations (app)
docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django python manage.py migrate
docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django python manage.py createsuperuser

```


## Settings

Moved to [settings](http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html).

## Basic Commands

### Setting Up Your Users

- To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

- To create a **superuser account**, use this command:

```bash
docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django python manage.py createsuperuser
```

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

### Type checks

Running type checks with mypy:

    mypy educa

### Test coverage

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report:

```bash
docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django coverage run -m pytest
```

```bash
docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django coverage html
```

```bash
docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django open htmlcov/index.html
```

#### Running tests with unittest

```bash
docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django python manage.py test
```

#### Running tests with pytest

```bash
docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django pytest
```

### Live reloading and Sass CSS compilation

Moved to [Live reloading and SASS compilation](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing-locally.html#sass-compilation-live-reloading).

### Celery

This app comes with Celery.

To run a celery worker:

``` bash
cd educa
celery -A config.celery_app worker -l info
```

Please note: For Celery's import magic to work, it is important *where* the celery commands are run. If you are in the same folder with *manage.py*, you should be right.

### Email Server

In development, it is often nice to be able to see emails that are being sent from your application. For that reason local SMTP server [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) with a web interface is available as docker container.

Container mailhog will start automatically when you will run all docker containers.
Please check [cookiecutter-django Docker documentation](http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment-with-docker.html) for more details how to start all containers.

With MailHog running, to view messages that are sent by your application, open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8025`

### Sentry

Sentry is an error logging aggregator service. You can sign up for a free account at <https://sentry.io/signup/?code=cookiecutter> or download and host it yourself.
The system is set up with reasonable defaults, including 404 logging and integration with the WSGI application.

You must set the DSN url in production.
